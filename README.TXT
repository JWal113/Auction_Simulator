2. Purpose
The project will conduct two different auctions and find the winners within each auction.
There will be a classic auction and a blind auction, and the buyers and sellers participating will be loaded in from txt files.
The sellers are given a name, item, and price, while buyers are given a bidder number, name, randomized budget, and risk factor, which dictates how much of their budget they will bid on an item.
Both auctions run separately, and the winners of one auction do not affect the others. After one auction occurs, the budgets and winners reset.
At the classic auction, one item will be auctioned off each round, and buyers will bid based on their risk factors.
After each round of bidding, the price of the item will increase incrementally until one buyer outbids the rest.
A buyer is taken out of the bidding round if they donâ€™t have any more of their budget to bid.
In each round, one buyer wins, and their bid will be reduced from their budget for the next round.
Players who got out one round can still be in the next round for a new item.
The auction will run for all the items in the list of sellers.
Similarly, in the blind auction, each round will have one of the seller's items up for auction.
Buyers will all place one bid and the buyer with the highest one will win the item, their bid is reduced from their budget for the next round.
We chose to build an auction because it simulates a real-world scenario and requires a higher degree of complexity that utilizes
the content we learned over this semester.
